### Hi there 👋

Originally from California, I currently work as a Data Engineer @ Amazon in London. I currently work with Amazon's Prime Video, and I have previously worked in the gaming industry 🎮, the automotive 🏎️ & powersports 🏍️ industries, and FinTech.

I really enjoy using Python 🐍 and SQL, and learning anything related to data engineering.

🌱 I hope to continue acquiring more knowledge/experience with Kafka, distributed computing (Spark), and cloud technologies (AWS, GCP)

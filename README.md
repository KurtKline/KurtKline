### Hi there 👋

Originally from California, I currently work as a Data Engineer in Frankfurt, Germany. I currently work in FinTech, and I have previously worked in the gaming industry 🎮 and the automotive 🏎️ & powersports 🏍️ industries.

In my current role I primarily construct ETL pipelines using Python 🐍, SQL, and Airflow for scheduling. The data I use comes from APIs, FTPs, databases, and Kafka topics. 


🌱 I’m hoping to learn more about Kafka, distributed computing (Spark), and cloud technologies (AWS, GCP)
